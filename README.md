# Pat's Salmon Cookies - 201 week 2 lab project

This is the infamous Salmon Cookies project, week 2 project for Code Fellows Code 201. Day one I am adding five object literals, one each for a fictional store in five different cities. I'll be using mock data to simulate sales date for cookies purchased per hour per customer in each store location. Data will be stored in a list on the sales.html page.

Update: 
Replaced object literals with a single constructor function. Constructor now creates a table on the sales.html page instead of a list with each stores individual data when each store's instance is created. Separate functions in the js file to add a header and footer to the table with store hours and sales totals.

Update: 
A form has been added that allows new data to be taken in and added to the table as a new store. CSS styling has been added.
