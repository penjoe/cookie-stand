# Pat's Salmon Cookies - 201 week 2 lab project

This is the infamous Salmon Cookies project, week 2 project for Code Fellows Code 201. Day one I am adding five objects, one each for a fictional store in five different cities. I'll be using mock data to simulate sales date for cookies purchased per hour per customer in each store location.
