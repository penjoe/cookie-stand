# Pat's Salmon Cookies - 201 week 2 lab project

This is the infamous Salmon Cookies project, week 2 project for Code Fellows Code 201. Day one I am adding five object literals, one each for a fictional store in five different cities. I'll be using mock data to simulate sales date for cookies purchased per hour per customer in each store location. Data will be stored in a list on the sales.html page.

Update: 
Replaced object literals with a single constructor function. Constructor now creates a table on the sales.html page instead of a list with each stores individual data when each store's instance is created.
